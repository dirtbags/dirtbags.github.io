title: Project 2 @ Defcon 21
---

We ran the Project 2 contest at Defcon 21, August 1-4, 2013.  The contest
was designed to appeal to beginners, ramping up to puzzles which would
intrigue the most skilled hackers.

We had 169 teams register, with 125 teams scoring points.  Given that teams may
have consisted of multiple players, this made Project 2 one of the largest
contests at Defcon. The previous year, Project 2 had 58 scoring teams which means the
contest had more than doubled in size.

pwnies scored themselves a Bus Pirate after winning the contest.  The
competition was fierce this year, even pro-CTFer's took part in our puzzles.

A new experience for Project 2 this year were attendees attacking our
infrastructure.  Some of the team names introduced garbage in the scoreboard.
There were some crazy Australians that found a hilarious directory traversal in
the console.

And again, nearly every puzzle was solved this year!  This means we are going
to have to do a lot of work in the next 12 months. Planning for 2014 started
the week after DC21, so prepare yourself for new puzzles in some interesting
subjects in 2014.
