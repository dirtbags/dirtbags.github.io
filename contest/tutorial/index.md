Here are a few simple puzzles, a taste of the type of puzzles you're
likely to find in our events.  We try to design puzzle categories to
teach as you progress through them: this allows people with no
experience to learn something, while still providing a challenge for
those who are able to progress more quickly.

* [Introduction](intro.html) to Dirtbags CTF: what it is, how to play, etc.
* [Counting](counting.html) in different bases
