Title: Tracer Fire 6M

Tracer Fire 6M was held April 21-23
at the 2015 DOE Cybersecurity Training Conference
in Kansas City, Missouri.

There were around 25 attendees to this miniature,
preview version of Tracer FIRE.

You may view a [snapshot of the scoreboard](scoreboard.html).

I also have a few [photos](photos/) taken at the event.
