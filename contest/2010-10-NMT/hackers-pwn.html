<p>The lights were dim, techno music pulsed out a steady beat from unseen speakers, and half-empty bottles of caffeinated beverages littered every available surface. The scene was the Fidel Center Ballroom, but no one was dancing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The event was Capture the Flag 2010, a hacking competition where teams of young computer scientists engaged in a test of skills that could ultimately help prepare them for key roles defending against cyber attacks on the nation's critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sam Olmsted, who's in his fourth year at Tech, led a team of freshmen into the fray, a two-day challenge that took place on Oct. 29 and 30. On the eve of battle, he and his troops gathered to explain the contest.</p>
<p>"It's meant to get people familiar with all kinds of cyber attacks, and prepare people to deal with real world situations in cyber security," he said. "I can't be more excited. They test this event on us, then it gets used to test at the (Department of Energy) and the national labs. Tech has a reputation for excellence. They want to see, can we break their system?"</p>
<p>Getting started</p>
<p>The event consists of tasks in a variety of categories, including code-breaking, programming, digital forensics, finding hidden threats, and attacking and defending weak or faulty systems. As the teams solve problems, they acquire points and unlock new categories and harder problems.</p>
<p>"What these kids are doing is sort of simulation of what a real computer security analyst would be doing on a day to day basis," said Neale Pickett, who masterminded the competition. "So they're able to, in a safe, constrained environment — none of the stuff can get out of the room — practice and try new things out without any repercussions."</p>
<p>Pickett is a cyber security expert from the Advanced Computing Solutions Program Office at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p>"What they're doing in there is really a war-game situation," he said.</p>
<p>The term war-game might sound like a strange way to describe young men and women sitting in the dark around piles of cords, cables and servers, pounding keyboards and staring intensely into the screens of their lap-top computers. There's an increasing likelihood, however, that the future of war is electronic.</p>
<p>Almost everything we use has some kind of computer in it or controlling its operation. Quite often, when there's a problem with the computer, the solution is to reboot it — to turn it off, and then turn it on again.</p>
<p>"There's a thing called a SCADA device," Pickett explained. "The early ones were just switches connected to a phone line, and you could call the thing and enter a touch-tone number and it would turn off an electrical outlet, and you could enter another touch-tone number and it would turn it back on — and so that was a way of power-cycling something, rebooting your computer from a long way away."</p>
<p>These SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) devices, Pickett said, are used in everything from elevators to power company substations. Rather than deploying people to flip switches, companies can reboot the computers remotely.</p>
<p>"And then they realized they could use the Internet, and save even more money, because they don't need a phone number anymore," he said. "And now you have a problem, because they didn't build in adequate protections on these things, and so they're vulnerable."</p>
<p>SCADA devices are now used to control and monitor traffic signals, gas pumps, wastewater systems and just about everything else in the industrial world, including nuclear plants and oil refineries.</p>
<p>"They're being deployed by electrical engineers, high voltage electrical engineers, which, while they're working with electrons, are pretty disjointed from the computer scientists, who would know a lot about computer security vulnerabilities," Pickett said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, anything that's accessible by the Internet has the potential to be vulnerable to a cyber attack, and that's where the young hackers come in.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>One of Pickett's goals in setting up contests such as the one last weekend at Tech is to generate interest in the field of cyber security, while seeking out talented individuals who might be recruited to do security work at the federal level.</p>
<p>"By letting the kids act in the role of the bad guys, we're also giving them more of an idea about what sorts of attacks to expect, because once you start, if you're just operating on the defense, then it makes it really hard to anticipate what the offense might do," he said. "So we're letting them do things that are illegal."</p>
<p>For some of the members of Olmsted's team of freshmen, who called themselves "Cinderella," the experience was a little like being thrown in the deep end of the pool, but they did remarkably well, coming in second and beating the heavily favored Scholarship For Service team.</p>
<p>"Scholarship For Service is a program funded by the NSF (National Security Agency) and supported by the Department of Homeland Security," said Dr. Lorie Liebrock, chairwoman of the Computer Science Department and faculty sponsor for the competition. "It trains students in information assurance, and pays for their last two years of school, including tuition, room and board, books, and a stipend, to then go work for the government."</p>
<p>Liebrock said the program has been operating at Tech since 2003, and has resulted in Tech graduates being placed in the National Security Agency, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, the Defense Information Systems Agency, and the Sandia, Los Alamos and Idaho national laboratories, working in government security.</p>
<p>"This year it was an interesting contest," Pickett said. "I've run a lot of these, I think this is the seventh one, and I've never seen so much contention for so long. Usually someone pulls ahead as a clear winner, pretty quickly, but it was neck and neck."</p>
<p>One team, calling themselves the Spring Loaded Flying Intestines, did emerge as the winner.</p>
<p>"It was the only team with any women on it," Pickett said, who would like to be able to recruit more women in the field. "The group that I'm in at Los Alamos is seven or eight men, and one woman. From my perspective, that means that there are six or seven women out there who are just as talented that we haven't found. I'm looking for brains. It's like we're missing out on half of the brains that we could be getting, because for whatever reason, we've structured our society in such a way that these women aren't getting to where they need to be."</p>
<p>Pickett acts as a mentor to Ellen Ochoa, a technical intern at LANL who was in charge of the social engineering category in the contest, which challenged the teams to find ways to get people to divulge confidential information, such as their bank account or Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>"As more of what we depend on happens in computer networks, the incentive to break into these networks rises. We've seen this with identity theft, something we hadn't heard of 20 years ago," Ochoa said.</p>
<p>Ochoa agreed that more women are needed in computer science.</p>
<p>"We may be losing out on people who could be good at this," she said.</p>
<p>Focusing on young talent</p>
<p>Pickett said his focus lately has been trying to break into New Mexico high schools, and he's been working on finding a way to collaborate with the New Mexico Supercomputing Challenge, program that promotes computer science at the high school level.</p>
<p>"Because this is really exciting, especially for younger people," he said. "And I think there's a tremendous opportunity to bring a lot of people in to this exciting field, when they might not have realized they were interested in it before."</p>
<p>For the Cinderella team, many of them high school students themselves only six months ago, there's no question the hacking competition was exhilarating on many levels. The dim lights, caffeine and techno music just add to the intensity of the experience, and are apparently standard for hacking competitions at the most elite levels, to which many of the members appear to be destined to rise.</p>
<p>Olmsted described the experience in terms of a kind of synergy, where by brainstorming and working as a group, they could produce a result that was better than if they worked alone, and in the process, each member became that much better.</p>
<p>"As we're working on it, we can learn from each other, because we can watch and see what other people are doing, and figure out, like, that's really cool, how are they doing that," he said.</p>
<p>Liebrock was equally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>"I'm really happy that the students are really engaged in something that gives them experience for internships and opens up so many opportunities," she said.</p>
<p>The members of the Cinderella team said they're confident they'll be well prepared for whatever opportunities the future may hold.</p>
<p>"It's so exciting, there are so many options available in terms of cyber security and just computer science in general," Olmsted said. "I get sort of dizzy just thinking about the options."</p>
