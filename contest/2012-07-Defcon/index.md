title: Project 2 @ Defcon 20
---

We ran the Project 2 contest at Defcon 20, July 26-29 2012.  The contest
was designed to appeal to beginners, ramping up to puzzles which would
intrigue the most skilled hackers.

We had 108 teams register, with 58 scoring points.  Given that teams may
have consisted of multiple players, this made Project 2 one of the
largest contests at Defcon.

The winners were team swordfish, consisting of David and Aviel.  Their
prize was a can of pringles, and a lot of photos with the 2012 Rollercon
Mountain Cats (Roller Derby team).

Nearly every puzzle was solved this year!  This means we are going to
have to do a lot of work in the next 12 months.  We're happy people
enjoyed the contest and look forward to confounding you again in 2013.
