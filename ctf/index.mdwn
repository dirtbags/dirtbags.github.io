Title: Capture The Flag

We run computer security trainings and contests for high schools,
colleges, and professionals.  Our events can focus on any combination of
network or host forensics, binary reverse engineering, incident
response, network or systems administration, secure coding, rapid code
prototyping, penetration testing, and much more.

Unlike most CTF exercises, our event does not typically have attack/defend
roles.  Instead, teams usually compete to solve problems quickly and
move on to the next one.  This is a result of the forensic nature of our
primary event: [Tracer FIRE](http://csr.lanl.gov/tf/).
