Title: Dirtbags @ Defcon 19

We will be running the Project 2 contest at Defcon 19.  This drop-in
event for individuals will be unlike anything we've run before, with a
new look and feel and all-new puzzles.  It will require some of the
same skills as prior CTFs, along with new skills we've never had
categories for before.
