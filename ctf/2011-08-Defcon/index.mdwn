Title: Dirtbags @ Defcon 19

We ran the Project 2 contest at Defcon 19, August 5-7 2011.  The contest
was designed to appeal to beginners, ramping up to puzzles which would
intrigue the most skilled hackers.  The contest was designed as an
Augmented Reality Game, with a complex backstory which would be revealed
as players proceeded through puzzles.

Unbeknownst to us, the Defcon 19 badge was being designed by LostboY
also as an Augmented Reality Game.  This overshadowed any story we could
possibly have come up with; and honestly, we'd be hard pressed to outdo
LostboY.  We believe that our plan to compel people to play out of
curiosity was undermined by the bigger and better badge story.

Despite the overlap with the badge contest, we had easily over 100
players, with 49 making at least one point and 17 spending enough time
to make at least 10 points.  Not much of the story was uncovered, so we
may re-use it later (probably not at Defcon though).

The contest ended officially at noon on Sunday, but 6 teams requested we
continue running the contest, which we did until about 3:30pm

One of the most exciting outcomes we observed was that players began
helping each other out.  Even the eventual winner was providing hints
and tips to other players.

You may view the [scoreboard](scoreboard.html), as captured at the time
we turned off the server.

We'll be back at Defcon 20 in 2012 if we're permitted, with updated
puzzles and better coordination with other contests.  We've gotten a lot
of excited feedback from players who plan to come back either alone or
in teams and we'll make sure we can accomodate both.
