  A dirtbag making science.

The Dirtbags are a group of computer security professionals.  We provide
[software](/g.cgi) and run [training/contests](/ctf/), focused primarily
on forensic incident response.

In addition to professional training, our contests are also suitable
for college and high school students.  Our 4-hour to 2-day events
help create interest in digital forensics and general computer science.
Read about [past events](/ctf/) or [contact us](mailto:zephyr@dirtbags.net)
to discuss hosting a dirtbags event at your school.
