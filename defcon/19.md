New Contest
-----------

A few of us are going to put together and run a [new
contest](/ctf/2011-08-Defcon/) at Defcon 19.  Let's hope it doesn't
suck.


CTF Quals Team
--------------

We will work on the CTF qualifying round this year.  As described in
the "welcome" email to our team list:

> Once again, my personal intent isn't to show off what a badass I am, but
> to get ideas for new puzzles in [my own contest](/ctf/). I am therefore not

> for four days straight in August.

The quals are always a lot of fun, and there's not much pressure if
you go into it not hoping to actually qualify.  If you'd like to join
the dirtbags team, contact me <zephyr@dirtbags.net> to get a team hash
to use on the [registration
page](https://www.ddtek.biz/reg/dc19_reg.jsp).


The Dirtbus
-----------

Last year's dirtbus didn't result in the sort of team cohesion we were
hoping for—frankly, it was a PITA—so you have to find your own ride
and room this year.
