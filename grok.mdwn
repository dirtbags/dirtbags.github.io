[[!meta title="Grok Overview"]]

Grok is a web-based Internet Protocol (IP) search tool designed to help
the user find and analyze network sessions in close to real time (5
minute).  It relies on the output generated by a packet capture and
session summary tool called `bag`.

The `bag` program runs on a Linux system, and continuously generates
5-minute full packet capture `libpcap` files, Internet session summary
files, and interface statistic files, rount-robin, over a period limited
to the amount of disc storage available to the system.  In the LANL
case, an 8-terabyte file system accomodates seven days of data (most of
the time).

Summary information, such as top 20 outgoing and incoming network
services (such as www/tcp or 161/udp), along with network interface
statistics which indicated the health of the capture system, are plotted
every 5 minutes for display by the Grok web server.

The Grok home page presents the analyst with a set of search criteria
used to query the information being collected by the bag program.  Since
the information ultimately resides in `pcap` files, other `pcap` aware
programs, such as `bro`, `wireshark`, `nosehair`, `smacqq`, `snort`, and
`tcpdump` have been incorporated into Grok's web interface.  Clickable
documentation is avaliable for each search criteria.
