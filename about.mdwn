[[!meta title="About the Dirtbags"]]

dirtbags.net was started as a place to release some projects we
had created in the never-ending arms race that is network security.
People beyond the developers have expressed interest in some of these
projects, and now they can be shared and discovered anew the world over.


Founding Members
================


Brughdiggity (Alexander Brugh)
------------------------------

Alex is an accomplished complainer.  He's also the only one of us who
ever takes notes, which means he's usually the only one who has any idea
what the crap is going on.


Core Net (C. Philip Wood)
-------------------------

Phil Wood, alias cpw, wrote grok and bag.  He has contributed to such
perennial Unix favorites as traceroute, libpcap, and snort.  He has been
accused of writing "the entire Internet", but he firmly denies this.


Fish (Michael Fisk)
-------------------

He's not the guy from the movie "Contact", but we suspect they based the
character on Fish.


zephyr (Neale Pickett)
----------------------

Neale wrote py-pcap and some other junk.  His never-ending quest to
reimplement existing software for marginal gains eventually drove him to
working with these dirtbags.


Our name
========

"Dirtbag" is the term Phil uses for pretty much anybody he has to spend
time investigating.  It's kinda catchy, and the domain name was available,
so what the hey.
