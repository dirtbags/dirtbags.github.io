[[!meta title="Download Grok"]]

We are still working on making a nice package for grok; in the meantime,
here's what we have.

[Phil Wood's site](http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/grok/) is the official
source for all LANL releases.  His tarballs are mirrored here:

* [grok 1.3](grok-1.3-src.1210096506.tar.gz)
* [bag 1.3](bag-1.3.20071203.tar.gz)

You may also clone the git repos to track development at aimudbot.com:

    $ git clone http://aimudbot.com/grok/repos/grok
    $ git clone http://aimudbot.com/grok/repos/bag

Lastly, you may [browse the code](repos/) online.
